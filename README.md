# Drunkit

This is the source release for [drunkit.co.uk](https://drunkit.co.uk)

## Requirements

This is an ancient site written when I was in my 20s. It needs Perl and PHP. It likely won't run on anything other than Apache and Linux. There's a separate project (TBD) which has everything needed to run Drunkit in a container.

## Users

Drunkit doesn't store users very securely, so they're not here. Nor are the forums right now as that's all in a database anyway.

## Forums

The forums theme is here - but I haven't included the rest of the PHPBB 3.x installation that Drunkit uses

## Misc

There might be holes and problems. This shouldn't be unexpected.
