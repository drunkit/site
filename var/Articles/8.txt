Unfortunately I'm going to see Harry Hill that night so I won't be able to. %0A%0AI am definately going to go to one in the future though. ;Alex B:Yay. Harry Hill. Several of my mates went to that the night before last. It was apparently very good. My mate Catherine was dressed up as a hamster.;Alex B:Oh yeah, and damn good article Sam. ;Sam:Bob - its not very big at all (Sams gf);Matt:Count me in; although with that much carnage, I'm not sure I'd survive to tell the tale!

Article=After two quiet months at the Bull (general drunkeness but nothing excessive) we, as a group, decided things had to change.%0A%0AArriving at 8.30, we were the first people to step inside Zanzibar (where the Bull is hosted).  My aim, along with several other people, was to drink the first 2 pints (i.e. 20 shots) before 9.00.%0A%0AUnfortunately it tastes so bad I struggled quite a bit, and finished pint 2 slightly late.  Then Matt G and his mates arrived and I bought a third pint.%0AThen I woke up in my bed on Friday morning with a buzzing head the taste of beer in my mouth.%0A%0AMost people's memories are equally hazy, although we've managed to piece together vaguely what happened.%0AI apparently decided to take a minor tactical chunder after just 2 pints (not sure why I needed to?).  This prepared me well for the next pint, which went down slightly too fast.  Within 30 mins I was back over the toilet, although this time involuntarily.  A bouncer found me and escorted me off the premesis, but amazingly told me if I sobered up in 20 mins I could come back in!%0A%0AMy mate Jim had followed me out to see that I was OK, he then bought me a kebab and I proceeded to run, full pace, around the block 3 times.  I then had to walk up and down the street in front of the bouncer to prove I was 'sober', and he let me back in.  I then kept drinking and came home at 2.00, when Jim spent 30 mins banging on my door chanting "I want to see your willy".  I duly obliged, then went back to bed.%0A%0ARich was in a much worse state than me - he was kicked out for being sick, but was given a lift home in the special VodBull SickMobile, a Mercedes with bin bags covering the seats which takes ill people home for free!  He had to be dragged up the stairs and put to bed.%0AAlso sick were Chris, Jim, Roberto and Mark.  A poor showing from Charlie and Rob, who weren't at all sick.%0A%0AMatt's mate Simon got thrown out and decided to walk home (it's at least 45 mins, sober, to where he lives!)  Apparently stumbled onto a green at Edgbaston Golf Course, where he got terrified when he saw another person standing there.  As he looked closer, he realised it was actually a flag...%0A%0A%0AAlthough VodBull is usually every 4 weeks, they are having an End Of Term Spectacular on Thursday March 28th.  If anyone fancies coming up and witnessing the mayhem first hand then you are welcome.  It will be mad.%0A%0ADustbin%0A%0A
