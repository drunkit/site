article=Notable events of last night%3A%0A%0APhil King was in Mission!%0A%0AI staggered up to him and congratulated him for scoring the winning penalty for Villa against Inter Milan in the UEFA Cup a few years ago.%0A%0AHe owns a pub in Rodbourne now.%0A%0AThere was a major shoe-thrown-on-the-roof incident outside at 2.00  They were Katherine's, worth £100 (according to her), worth £50 (according to Charlotte).  Some random guy stole it and threw it onto the mechanics roof, so someone else had to climb up and get it!%0A%0AThere was a Missionman lookalike, who I was introduced to.  His first words were "I'm not Andy".  He owns something in Swindon, can't remember what...%0A%0AJames was feeling outraged that he had won the "Most Chaos on a Night Out" poll - we both agreed that Elliott should be the clear winner.  Being declared dead by the college caretaker takes some beating!%0A%0ALeigh was refused entry for wearing trainers, which is pretty ridiculous considering he was looking smarter than many people in there.%0A%0AChris Cundy was big and gay, kept trying to lick men's nipples and feel their arses...  Was wearing a comedy Hawaiin Shirt, quite similar to James' effort.%0A%0ANathan was persuaded to come out at the last minute - had to run home and get changed and meet us in the queue.  Thought it would be hilarious to buy me gin in his round!%0A%0AAll very good fun - again, horrific disapointment with the DJ at the end, who didn't play either The Riverdance, or Hawaii 50 or even Ski Sunday!  This was always a highlight of my evening, he needs to sort it out.  I will continue to stage a 1-man protest by remaining on the dancefloor with my arms folded, waiting for him to finish the night, until he decides to do so.%0A%0AI'm at work now drawing pretty graphs with Excel, which is very exciting.%0A%0ASee you next Thursday!%0A%0ADustbin
