Article=Me and dj comrade (sorry mate, no war connotations) attended the Burn FM awards safe in the knowledge thatwe were nominated for best new mainstream show, at the hideously trendy 52 degrees north bar, purhasing stella bottles at £2.80 a piece (ouch), until finding the superb red wine at half price and proceeding to dring the first of 6 bottles between us.%0A%0AMiraculously we won the aforementioned award, before flattering comparisons to mark and lard (more like lard and lard) and the promise of a prime time slot next time out, by our female bosses, who miraculously appeared at the merest mention of award winners.  There after it all went missionesque, with no recollection of the night but waking up at 6 the next morning in the toilet covered in red wine and spaghetti bolognese bunder.%0A%0AThis proceeded my four day birthday drinking extravaganza, and recovery before the almighty countdown to the legendary vodbull, no longer known as censored and almost certian to be messier than ever.%0A%0APs thanks to potato warrior for informing me of his identity, i hope you're cover has not been blown.
