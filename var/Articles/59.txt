article=Well seeing as NOBODY is around on Drunkit I guess it’s up to me to tell you bunch of people what I got up to...%0A%0A31st of December 2003. Time for beer. I drove up to Blunsden to pick the happy little drunken Elliott. We grooved all the way back to Swindon singing along to the sweet sounds of Frank Sinatra in my car. %0A%0AThen we jump to the Savoy. Elliott and I met up with Tim and Anna at about 1%3A45 and started on a few pints. Elliott decided as we were starting early a few espressos would be in order. So 5 pints of beer and 5 strong coffee shots later and I was feeling top of the weather. This is where the others started to arrive. Bob, Marie, Brad, Lewis, Mattock, Kirsty Deano, Jo, Martin, Donald, Ian, Duncan, Titcombe and others... sorry if I forgot you. %3A-(%0A%0AIt must have been about 7%3A00 by now. I starting on the vodka red bull and was starting to feel a little bit mongoosed. We left pretty sharpish so I had to down my drink... grr! After some deep deep breaths I managed to hold back on being sick. %0A%0AWe wandered down to town to go to Revolutions... They wouldn't let us in because we weren't over 21. Bastards. Not long till I'm 21 and I can shove it back in their big gay faces.%0A%0ASo we decided on Edwards. I was drunk now. Drunk as a skunk. They were giving out presents on the door. Top Hats, fluffy feather boa things, tiaras and teddy bears. I got nothing because they must have thought I was too manly to want any of that gay stuff. %0A%0A%0AInstead I found one of each (apart from he teddy bear) in the toilet. JACKPOT! Ell and me decided it was 11%3A30 on new years and we could still walk properly. So we went to the bar and had some shots (6 if I remember correctly!). %0A%0ASo now monstered up, I decided to go for one of my infamous walks to find some happy campers. Can’t remember much apart from talking to Paul North. Then it was midnight. There was no count down or anything! It just went bong, booooooong boooooong. Very shit indeed. %0A%0ASo we left Edwards about 1%3A00 to go somewhere more fun. Nowhere would let us in so we thought a curry would be wise. I found a hedgehog named Steve on the way home. He was a decent addition to the group. I also walked past Sam who seemed to be sitting on the floor outside the Savoy in just a T-shirt. We had a friendly hug then went on our way.%0A%0AIn the curry house most of us were making a fool out of ourselves, talking to Rakesh and his bird! I feel sorry for the poor Curry man. He must have hated me. If he does then I don’t care. I’m just going to sit here and groove on it. %0A%0AWe met someone from The Salon in there. She was hot and knows my cousin. Cool hey? %0A%0AI was sick in the toilet before we left. But we wont go into that. %0ALet me just say this is going to be the biggest understatement I’ve ever written. The walk home was not good.  Its was COLD, WET, WINDY, RAINY, SMELLY,  DARK, RUBBISH, GAY, SHIT, TOO FUCKING CRAPPY RAINY AND COLD TO SURVIVE THE TRIP HOME. So we stopped in a doorway to be less cold. Jo needed to get a taxi and there was no way on earth I was walking her home. I would be dead right now if I had. BUT NO TAXIS%3A’(. So we had to walk to my house in the coldest shittest cold EVER. It was about as fun as being the designated driver at Vodbull. %0A%0ASo me Jo, Donald and Elliott sat in my kitchen trying to get a taxi and listening to Donald’s stories…. Lets not bother going into that. It will only get on your nerves.%0A%0ASo, the usual night out really. New years never lives up to its name… but hey ho it could be worse. I had a fun time and if you didn’t then I laugh at you. Ha ha. %0A%0ABye%0A
