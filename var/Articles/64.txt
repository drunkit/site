article=Hello, from now on, drunkit.co.uk redirects to this article. You can view the original home page <a href%3D"https%3A//www.drunkit.co.uk/bin/welcome">here</a>.%0A%0AOn the off-chance that you're visiting drunkit to see what's going on here, the answer is not a lot. The forum is being attacked by spammers, the articles section is dead and the hit counter is near-zero.%0A%0AWe had a great thing going here once upon a time, but as we move in to our professional and more distant lives, Drunkit is less relevent.%0A%0ABefore you say goodbye for good, why not browse a few of the <a href%3D"https%3A//forums.drunkit.co.uk/">older forum articles</a> or take a look at some of the <a href%3D"https%3A//www.drunkit.co.uk/bin/articles">articles</a>?%0A%0AWhatever happens to us all now we're further apart, let's try and not lose contact. Drunkit's philosophy was to keep people together, let's live that through our own actions and make sure we live to do one more Steam Railway --> Mission night!%0A%0AThis is Matt Day, signing out from Drunkit for the last time...

comments=;matt:Maybe, if you see this here, you could post a comment in the form of an everlasting eulogy.;joeyjojo:R.I.P. Drunkit %3A-(;alex d:In my heart, Drunkit will NEVER die!;matt:I just removed the last of the spam (more or less) from the forums and also banned most of the spamming accounts and (hopefully) made it impossible for them to come back. They suck, as it makes it hard to browse the forums to see the really funny stuff %3A-(
