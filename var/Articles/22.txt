article=Last night was a very strange Thursday night.  It DIDN'T involve going to Mission!  In the list of wierd things that have happened to me in my life, this must rank pretty highly, probably alongside the time when I saw Elvis being abducted by aliens in a field near Wanborough.%0A%0AOur evening began in the Curry Garden, with Jez CC, Kathryn, Matt D & Matt G.  Topics of conversation included the operational problems regarding a nuclear fusion power plant, a cost/benefit analysis of particle accelerators and whether lime pickle was nicer than mango chutney.  A few popadoms, currys, nan breads and a couple of Kingfishers later we found ourselves in the Steam Railway.%0A%0AHere we worked our way through their fine selection of guest ales (several times), saw Lance Newton who was very drunk and very proud of his tattoo, slagged off public schools and saw a helicopter.%0AWe planned a masseeeve night next Thurs involving sitting in my garden with some beer and getting drunk before going to Mission!  Where do we get these ideas from?%0AMatt Day was well up for going to Mission after a few beers, but Greenaroo & I had to be more restrained due to todays activities.  By about 10.55 I had a pint and a half of ale in front of me, but Matt, despite my protestations, went and bought another round.  I couldn't down it all, so by the time we were kicked out there was a tragic amount of beer still left to be drunk.%0A%0AI was quite drunk by closing time, and the thought of stealing a 6X Garden Umbrella was a very attractive prospect.  Unfortunately everyone else left before we could formulate a plan, and I didn't fancy my chances of smuggling it out past the bouncers on my own.  Anyone who can steal it gets a congratulatory beer from me!%0A%0AWhen I got home I did some drunken texting - I have a long running fued with my mate Charlie from Uni about whether Thursdays are better than Mondays.  This message was still on my phone this morning%3A
