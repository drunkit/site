Article=The legend of VodBull returned to Birmingham on our first Thursday back after Christmas.%0ABefore going out, nerves were building - previous experiences have left people hospitalised, lost, without bladder control etc.%0A%0AWe had to go out and get battered beyond belief, but make sure that a vague element of control was there.%0AArriving at 8.40, the place is already filling up with dedicated VodBullers, wanting to get Double vodka/redbull for £1.  As ever, we started with 5 doubles in a pint glass.  The first drink is always a struggle, as it tastes so foul.  Redbull is a dirty drink.%0AWithin a few minutes we were talking bull shit and drinking our second pints.  I can remember it being about 9.30pm, I had been talking to Matt G for a bit. %0AThen there is total blank - I've got no idea who I was with, what I was doing, where I was, what I was drinking.  Apparently a very viscious game of slaps was going on, and we were singing Beatles songs in the toilet.%0AI'm sure I was loving it.%0A%0ANext thing I can remember having a pint of blue drink in my hand (no idea what it was) and I was escorting my rather worse-for-wear new girlfriend Claire to the medical room  at the request of the bouncers.  Not sure what happened in there, I think I was just amazed that the place existed, hidden away in the corner.%0A%0AWhen we got back we thought it would be hilarious to cover our mate (who was in bed) in shaving foam, honey and ketchup.  Even funnier to fill his shoes, socks and drawers with the stuff too, we really are great freinds!%0APeople started arriving home one by one.  Most had actaully survived the night, a very rare occurence.  Rich was the biggest liabillity, having walked to Moseley (about 2 miles in the wrong direction) by mistake.  He had been kicked out at 10.30 from what we gather, and turned up again at 4.30am without phone, wallet, keys...  His uncle had picked him up from an industrial estate where he had decided to go to sleep for the night!%0A%0ASarah & Claire where both very ill all night, really excelling themselves.  No one could stand up straight in the morning.   No one can remember ANYTHING other than the few vague details above!%0A%0AAll in all a fairly quiet VodBull by previous standards, I'll do a report on past experiences sometime soon.%0A%0ACan't wait till next month, if anyone wants to join in the fun then it should be returning in 4 weeks time.  Without doubt the best event in history.%0A%0ASam
