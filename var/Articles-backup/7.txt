Article=Wow, another VodBull, another night of drunken mayhem and lost memories.%0AThis 'Bull was very eagerly anticipated by all, especially as we had sober people going with cameras.%0AAs it was the day before Valentines, we made VodBull a special card, about 4 feet high, saying "We Love You VodBull".  We then thought it would be very comical to glue photos of us after previous VodBulls all over the front.  These included%3A%0ACharlie in hospital gown & sick bucket%0ARob wetting the bed%0AJim with fire in his eyes looking like an axe murderer due to so much Red Bull%0AMe collapsed in the corridor%0ACharlie passed out in the common room.%0A%0AWe all then wrote a personal Valentines message inside - for example, Dave wrote%3A "You took me to a place I never knew existed - Harbourne" (he had walked there by mistake last time!)%0A%0AWe all arrived at 8.30 and bought the customary 5 doubles each.  I decided it would be a fabulous idea to down these in as little time as possible, then buy 5 more.  Unsuprisingly this resulted in me being very drunk and very hyper.  My mind goes blank after the 2nd round.  Apparently I was singing football songs, falling over, and jumping around the toilets on my own!%0AThe card was presented to the DJ at some point during the night.  I doubt he was too impressed, although we thought it was hilarious...%0A%0AI can remember very little of the night, although apparently I enjoyed myself.  Rich drank slightly less than the last two occasions (when he got lost for a total of almost 10 hours in Birmingham) and so made it home in one piece.  No one was hospitalised, although some bloke who came out with us for his first VodBull was to be found hugging the toilet before 10pm having a multi-coloured yawn!%0A%0AI'm very excited about the photos, I'm expecting to see me doing lots of things I have no recollection of doing!%0A%0AIt's Carnage tonight, a 10 pub crawl through Birmingham town centre.  Can't wait.%0A%0ASam%0A
