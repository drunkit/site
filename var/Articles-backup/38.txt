article=sams report of the bull sums the event up perfectly.  In my capacity as a uni radio dj i've commandeered the 6-8 thursday night slot and now we officially have the vodbull build up show, and 3-5 on sat in the build up to the england match. if any drunkiteers want a butchers go to www.burnfm.com, and look at the webcam. my head hurts i think i had to much guiness and vodka last nite.
