However, I thought I'd visit it a few last times for nostalgic pleasure.%0A%0AThe site started back in 1999 as a fairly irresponsible way to promote hardcore drinking and club-going. At first we wrote a Mission review and encouraged others to submit their content. It started off slow, but we got some absolutely cracking stories.%0A%0AThe server died twice and the current iteration of Drunkit was written in late 2002 - six years ago.%0A%0AAs time progressed we opened up drunkit to be an entire community - in many ways an early Facebook. Drunkit became as much a part of a Thursday night in Mission as getting retardedly drunk.%0A%0AI invite you to browse through all the <a href%3D"https%3A//drunkit.co.uk/bin/articles">old articles</a> or have a look at some of these ones which are my favourites%3A%0A<ul><li><a href%3D"https%3A//drunkit.co.uk/bin/article/id,5/">Sam's introduction to Vodbull</a> - <em>"Next thing I can remember having a pint of blue drink in my hand (no idea what it was) and I was escorting my rather worse-for-wear new girlfriend Claire to the medical room"</em></li><li><a href%3D"https%3A//drunkit.co.uk/bin/article/id,10/">Bhavin's insane rants on Alternative Music</a> - <em>"no I'm not gay, just a pancy boy when it comes to drinking"</em></li><li><a href%3D"https%3A//drunkit.co.uk/bin/article/id,12/">Matt G's unnerving drunken antics</a> - <em>"with no recollection of the night but waking up at 6 the next morning in the toilet covered in red wine and spaghetti bolognese bunder"</em></li><li><a href%3D"https%3A//drunkit.co.uk/bin/article/id,16/">Alex B's reasons not to sit exams</a> - <em>"phobophobia-fear of fearing"</em></li><li><a href%3D"https%3A//drunkit.co.uk/bin/article/id,19/">Matt D's Adventures home with MissionMan</a> - <em>"Still being drunk first thing, I decided I could probably have a shot of whisky to 'tackle the hang over'."</em></li><li><a href%3D"https%3A//drunkit.co.uk/bin/article/id,26/">Sam's account of the Special Brew Helpline</a> - <em>"Matt Day swiftly answered the phone, put on his incredibly camp voice and claimed to be my Gay Lover.  “Sam can’t come to the phone right now, he’s just about to get dressed”."</em></li><li><a href%3D"https%3A//drunkit.co.uk/bin/article/id,23/">James' adventure in Wonderland</a> - <em>"The rest of the night was filled with running around, talking to Mr. Pizza box and falling in a well."</em></li><li><a href%3D"https%3A//drunkit.co.uk/bin/article/id,39/">Bobby's Big Bournemouth House Series</a> - <em>"At one point, one of the girls who was stripping realised that she wasnt actually wearing a bra so we got to see some full frontal action!"</em></li></ul>%0A%0AThere are probably more classic articles, so check them all out!%0A%0AFinally, <a href%3D"https%3A//forums.drunkit.co.uk/">the forum</a> has been left a little bit damaged due to someone deleting a lot of messages and rampant spamming, butfeel free to take a look at some of its inane bollocks!%0A%0AI know there's been talk of a reunion. I'm pretty sure this will happen at some point, but I don't think we can engineer that from Drunkit. So, treat this article as a last look at the site.%0A%0ADrunkit's not going anywhere and will be online for some time to come, but after you read a few of the articles (or all of them) and browsed through the forum I'm sure the fond memories of this great age will make you smile.
