There was a few minutes of tension before the match began, as our opposition did not seem to be coming, so we were getting ready to leave, but five minutes late, "The chance" arrived. They were a scrawny looking team, with quite a large defender at the back and no obvious goalkeeper, so confidence was high. %0A%0AKick off commenced and they seemed to be a lot quicker than Drunkits previous opponants and there was a tense few minutes where the match stayed at 0-0. But then the awesome skill and power of martin burst into action and he drove home a steamer from 6 yards. Again as the goals started hitting home thick and fast, it is hard to remember each goal, although martin did score the first four, with Skipper james pulling off a typical toe punt to make it 5-0. They did pull two back in the first half, both of which Bob did not have much chance with but they just couldnt keep up with the clever twists and turns of Martin and Gary and the slick passing movements of Rob and James. %0A%0AHalf time, and the score was 11-2. James pulled out his now traditional half time power sweets. Last time it was tic tacs, this week, the surprising choice of polos! %0A%0AAnyway the match started again and we picked up from were we left off and kept smacking them in. There was a little showboating starting again, especially between bob and james - a clever move where james cheekily passed the ball back to bob from long range, bob pulled off a bit of fancy footwork in his penelty area and flicked it back to james, a long ball into gary and another stunning goal. Although they did get a late goal, which flew through Bobs legs, the final score ended a convincing 19-3. %0A%0ASo up to the pub we went again, for some more celebratory pints - Bob and greg had Fosters, while James, Rob and martin had either coke or water (poofs!) and we toasted another great win. %0A%0AAfter the match skipper james had to say%3A%0A"It was a good result, the boys did well, we just got to keep it up for the rest of the season. Although it was quite a dissapointing attendence today, the fans were terrific. It was like having an extra player on the pitch." %0A%0ABob said %3A "I was pleased with the result, but dissapointed with my own performance. I shouldn't have let in the third goal- it went through my legs, which is quite surprising because i have such a big penis." %0A%0A------------------------------------------------------------ %0A%0AThe Bournemouth Uni Intramural wednesday 5-a-side football league table %0A%0ADrunkIt FC--------- Played%3A 2---- Won%3A 2----Goal Difference%3A +28------- Points%3A 6 %0A%0AAny Holes a goal--------Played%3A 2----Won%3A 2 ---- Goal Difference%3A +11 ------- Points%3A 6 %0A%0ASave Chip--------Played%3A 1----Won%3A 1 ---- Goal Difference%3A +13 ------- Points%3A 3 %0A%0ASpoon Badgers--------Played%3A 2----Won%3A 1----Lost%3A 1---- Goal Difference%3A +7 ------- Points%3A 3 %0A%0ANorfolk & Chance--------Played%3A 1----Lost%3A 1 ---- Goal Difference%3A -16 ------- Points%3A 0 %0A%0ASuper Noodles--------Played%3A 2----Lost%3A 2 ---- Goal Difference%3A -19------- Points%3A 0 %0A%0AVillage People--------Played%3A 2----Lost%3A 2 ---- Goal Difference%3A -24------- Points%3A 0 %0A%0AFixtures %0A%0A28/11/01 - Any Holes A Goal%0A5/12/01- Village People%0A16/01/02- Spoon Badgers%0A13/02/02 - Save Chip %0A%0A
