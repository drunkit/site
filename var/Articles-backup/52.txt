As we donned our 'Newcastle United' shirts (Rob from our team brought them as we havnt got any offical team strip at the moment), kick off commenced.%0AAnd straight from kick off, super noodles took a 'cheeky' shot from the half way line, which took all players by surprise. But Luckily for 'DrunkIt', young keeper Bob dove down to his Left and got a strong hand to it and it was played out to safety. Everyone on the Drunkit team was quite shocked and scared about this initial shock, thinking we were in for a battering. How wrong we were. %0A%0AAfter 0-0 for a minute, our first substitute Rob came on off the bench and duely thumped in our first goal of the afternoon. The crowd went wild and fists were punching the air. After that goal they started flooding in, and unfortunately after this first goal i cant remember who scored what goals in what order. We were 5-0 up but an unfortunate error by Bob, where he was in two minds whether or not to catch the ball or knock it over, and the ball flew threw his hands like a hot knife through butter. But this didnt dampen our already sky high spirits, and martin whacked another shot on the underside of the crossbar-there was debate whether or not the ball crossed the line or not, and the goal was disallowed. After 25 minutes (which should have been 15, but we suspected the super noodles wanted to get in a few extra goals) we were 5-1 up %0A%0ASome Halftime tic-tac tactics from james helped us to revitalise ourselves and we played a much more defensive formation in the second half- although it ended up with us scoring loads more goals. Already we were surprised with the skill of Martin and Gary- truely awesome players, as well as the all rounder Rob, we were actually looking forwards to the second half. %0A%0AThe goals kept rushing in and this half, it was the turn of james to run riot. He scored the 10th, 11th and 12th goals all in a row- a truely desrved hattrick and at this point some of the players started showboating and showing off a little. And this half also included an amusing own goal where a defensive mix up ended in a 'Super Noodles' player knock the ball into his own net! The crowd laughed and cheered at this cock up. They did have quite a few more efforts on goal in the second half, but they were usually wide or straight at Bob, and they did score a consolation goal at the end, but we replyed with another thumping goal from Rob. As the Final whistle went, Drunkit FC went mad with a screaming victory under our belts. %0A%0AAnd of course in true drunkit style, before we had even changed, washed or even cleaned all of the sand out of our pants, we were up at the union bar, sinking those victory pints and savoring the feeling of being top of our league. %0A%0AWe now have a 3 week break until the next big match, the 21st of november, so we'll put in some extra training and the intramural trophy will be back in Swindon in no time. %0A%0AAnd as an extra special treat for all the drunkit FC fans, Goalkeeper Bobby D, and Skipper James F, will be in mission night club this saturday night for autograph signings and photos. Any free drinks would be much appreciated. %0A%0A
