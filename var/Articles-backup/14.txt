Article=Yep we got Mission at 9.30pm...boy we thought that was yearly.  cock sucking teenagers.  The queue was massive I mean huge.  Bobby James and Elliot must have been there well early.  Fortunatly for me I was occompanied by three very good looking women.  I stooped to the level of the low and ended up pushing in at the front.  Once in Mission was its usal best, what was with  £1.50 a drink, I mean what happened £1.00 a drink.  %0A%0AI was amazed with music, breifly, the line up was Nirvana Smells like teen spirit, Blur Song 2, Reef Put your hands up, pretty cool.  It was a shame the Mission Hardcore, Matty Day, Sam the Leader of the Brumms Millard and Greenaway were unable to make it in.  Just wasn't the same without them.  %0A%0ANext week will be much better hopefully, livin' it up to the maximum.  cya all there!
