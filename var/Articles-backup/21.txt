article=I feel like Keanu Reaves this morning - I've got that instinct that not everything is quite right...  Things feel a little sketchy and not as they should be.  %0A%0AWhy?  Not because I'm living in a false Matrix world, but because last night was Tennants Super Night!%0AMy evening began with a Water Resources Department Staff BBQ at Halcrow.  You had to provide a bit of food for yourself, but beer was on the house.  I was presented with a fantastic selection - bottled 6X, canned Ruddles County, Yorkshire Bitter, Caffreys etc.  As most people had to drive home and therefore not drink too excessively, I took a few liberties and helped myself to 'several' beverages.  %0A%0ABy 9.00 when I got home, my Mum immediately asked "Are you drunk?" and proceeded to feed me with rice to 'soak up the alcohol'.  Unfortunately, all this did was gave me a taste for some more, so I went to Alex B's house where Tennants Super Night was in full flow.%0AOne can of this (an incredible 9%25 abv) and I was feeling the effects.  For those unlucky enough never to have tried such a fantastic drink, it tastes like a cross between cheap lager and cheap vodka, costs £1.15 a can, and gets you trolleyed!  We didn't find a park bench to drink it on, so Alex's back garden had to suffice.  The main topic of conversation was about how hard Dave is, and how we wouldn't want to push in any queue when he's in it! %0A%0AArriving at Mission late, we were concerned about the possibilty of excessive queueing.  However, to our delight, we walked virtually straight in.  I think then we met some people and drank some beer and had general 'fun'.  Someone else with a better memory can fill in the details.  I'm sure James was there, as were some other people, but I think Missionman wasn't.  %0A%0AI somehow ended up outide at 2.00, where Leigh and I began a huge debate about mothers, concluding with the consensus that they are great.  At around 4.00 I was staggering home.  I slept through this mornings alarm and was woken up by my Dad just in time to greab a bite to eat and cycle, somewhat haphazardly, into work.%0A%0AMy head is going round and round in circles, the world doesn't seem real, and I'm looking forwards to Tennants Super Night number 2, which will doubtlessly occur next Thursday!%0A%0AHappy Days!%0A%0ASam
