Ignore what you heard! Drunkit is back for one final(?) bang! A <a href="https://www.drunkit.co.uk/reunion"><strong>reunion</strong></a> is on its way! Stay tuned.

Official announcement: Drunkit is considered officially dead. Please see <a href="https://www.drunkit.co.uk/bin/article/id,64/">this article</a> for more information.

The site maybe dead in content and visitors, but it's here until at least Nov 2006...

Drunkit is dead. I can't see it coming back, but oh well!

Merry Christmas all!

We're back and badder than ever (in the badass sense of the phrase). The forums are <a href="https://forums.drunkit.co.uk/">back</a> and everything is cool. Sorry about the downtime!

Right. Yes, I know. Drunkit's been a bit gay lately and the forums don't work. Give me time... Should all be better by Sunday evening.

OK, Drunkit's back to how it used to be! Hooray! Some of the forum posts have gone bye-bye... Sorry about that, I'll try and recover them later. Check out the <a href="https://forums.drunkit.co.uk">Drunkit Forums</a>...

Easter was a bit of a drag for nights out... Never mind, summer's where it's at!

Maybe people could <a href='mailto:pics@drunkit.co.uk'>mail us</a> some more pictures to go up in the <a href='https://www.drunkit.co.uk/bin/content/page,pictures/'>pictures</a> section?

Times they are a changin'... With so many Drunkiteers being over 21 now, we could open an American operation... Or not.

Happy New Year to all Drunkiteers. Resolve to visit Drunkit more frequently in 2004!

I hope all Drunkiteers are having a good holiday! Share your new years plans in the <a href='https://forums.drunkit.co.uk'>forums</a>!

Merry Christmas to all Drunkiteers. Drive/walk safely and have a happy New Year!

We're back! No more down time for a while now... Thanks for staying patient. The <a href="https://forums.drunkit.co.uk">forums</a> are back and all is well!

The aforementioned facelift has finally happened! You can change to the new, superior theme, by going to <a href=https://www.drunkit.co.uk/bin/controlPanel?area=themes>theme central</a>.

A facelift is happening here on Drunkit... Check out the <a href="https://www.drunkit.co.uk/bin/welcome">new test page!</a>

We're still alive after the snakebite... but Drunkit is getting dead again! Go to the <a href="https://forums.drunkit.co.uk">forums</a> and get chatting!

Super snakebite will kill us! Join us for death a la pint!

The <a href='https://forums.drunkit.co.uk'>Drunkit Forums</a> are where we hang out now... Find us there!

New <a href='https://forums.drunkit.co.uk'>Drunkit Forums</a>. Use them. Love them. The messageboard will be gone soon if all goes to plan.

Last Thursday was good. More like that please.

Not much posting... less summertime and fun and more summertime drunkit!

Messageboard should be somewhat more pleasant now...

Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Yes, I will fix it! I'm going to have a quick kip, then I will start work... joy.

<a href='https://www.drunkit.co.uk'>Drunkit</a> - we will be great again.

Polls will be more frequent as I can update them over the web now.

Sorry we went offline for about an hour on Sunday 25th. A bit of a bastard problem with the code.

Smiley faces? Who needs them? We're all miserable bastards here on Drunkit.

Your username does not need to be in a particular case any more! Your password still does, however.

Bah, Drunkit is becoming tired again. Except a revival soon. Blah blah blah.

@Drunkit.com emails for EVERYONE coming soon.

Almost easter! I can taste the fun.

<b>MORE DEDICATION FROM PEOPLE NEEDED!</b> - That is all.

<b>Damn war!</b> There, I've just about summed up my annoyance with this entire farce-of-a-war.

Oh dear, we've died again. Come on people! More posting please! WE NEED DEDICATION!

I am working on a 'classic features' section for the old articles. Stay tuned.

Finally, we have a half-decent homepage for Drunkit! Stay tuned for more!

Welcome to the revamped Drunkit Today. Stay tuned for more messages and announcements from Drunkit.com
